# Water Quality Data Analysis, Variable Effects on Secchi Depth

### Secchi Depth is a measure of water clarity, often used in aquatic studies to assess the transparency of water. It refers to the depth at which a Secchi disk (a black-and-white circular disk) is no longer visible when lowered into the water. This measurement provides an indication of how much light can penetrate the water, which is important for understanding water quality and the health of aquatic ecosystems.

#### My goal is to determine what factors contribute to Secchi Depth.


## **EDA Methodology:**

1) Import required libraries  
2) Load dataset CSV as pandas dataframe  
3) Perform an initial data check  
4) Clean data   
5) Data exploration   
    A) Identify Outliers   
    B) Univariate Analysis   
    C) Transformations   
    D) Bivariate Analysis   
    E) Correlation Analysis   
6) OLS Regression Modeling  
7) Analysis of Regression Coefficients  
8) Conclusions
